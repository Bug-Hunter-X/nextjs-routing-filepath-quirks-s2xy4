# Next.js Routing and File Path Errors

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in Next.js applications related to file paths and routing.  Adding new pages or changing the file structure of the project can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect rendering or 404 errors, if routes aren't properly configured.

## The Problem
The `pages/index.js` file provided in this repo contains a seemingly innocuous Next.js application. However, modifications to the project's structure or the addition of new pages without careful consideration of Next.js's routing system can easily break the application.

## Solution
The solution file (`bugSolution.js`) illustrates how to handle this issue by meticulously managing the file structure and ensuring that new pages are properly accounted for within the `pages` directory (or by using custom routes if necessary).  Always double-check your file structure and routing configuration whenever making significant changes to your Next.js application.
