```javascript
// pages/index.js
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <p>This is my Next.js app.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This code seems simple, but it can produce unexpected behavior if you're not careful about how you structure your Next.js application.  The issue is related to how Next.js handles file paths and routing. If you add new pages or modify the file structure, you might encounter issues where the application fails to render correctly or the routing is broken. For instance, if you add a new page and don't properly configure the routes, you might get a 404 error.
